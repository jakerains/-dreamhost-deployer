# DreamHost Deployer v0.5.4 Release Notes

## Overview

We're excited to announce the release of DreamHost Deployer v0.5.4! This version introduces significant improvements to the deployment process, focusing on reliability, user experience, and error handling.

## Key Improvements

### Target Directory Check

DreamHost Deployer now checks if the target directory contains existing files before deployment, giving you options to:

- **Update existing files** while keeping other files intact
- **Clean the directory** and start fresh
- **Cancel deployment** if needed

This feature prevents accidental overwrites and gives you more control over the deployment process.

### Improved Connection Handling

We've completely revamped the SSH connection handling to address common issues:

- Replaced command-line SSH with the Node.js SSH2 library for more reliable connections
- Added connection timeout handling with longer timeouts and keepalive packets
- Implemented sequential directory creation to prevent overwhelming the server
- Enhanced error reporting with clear, actionable messages

### Enhanced File Transfer

File transfers are now more reliable and user-friendly:

- Files are transferred in batches to prevent server overload
- Small pauses between batches ensure smooth operation
- Improved progress reporting shows both batch and overall progress
- Better error handling allows deployment to continue even if some files fail

### Better Windows Compatibility

Windows users will experience significantly improved reliability:

- No dependency on command-line SSH tools
- Consistent behavior between Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Better handling of Windows-specific path issues
- More reliable authentication on Windows systems
