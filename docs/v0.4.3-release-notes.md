# DreamHost Deployer v0.4.3 Release Notes

This release focuses on adding password authentication support for DreamHost deployments, making it easier to deploy to servers where SSH key authentication is not available or not working.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Password Authentication Support

We've added comprehensive password authentication support:
- Interactive password prompts during deployment
- Option to save password in configuration (not recommended for security)
- Automatic fallback to password authentication if key authentication fails
- Support for both sshpass and expect-based password handling
- Password testing during SSH setup

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

We've improved error handling for SSH authentication issues:
- Better error messages for authentication failures
- Automatic retry with password if key authentication fails
- Detailed guidance for troubleshooting connection issues

### 3. Deployment Method Improvements

We've enhanced both rsync and SCP deployment methods:
- Password authentication support for rsync using sshpass
- Fallback to SCP if sshpass is not available
- Password authentication for SCP using both sshpass and expect scripts
- Better handling of SSH connection issues

## Using Password Authentication

To use password authentication:

1. **During Setup**: Run `dreamhost-deployer setup-ssh` and choose the password authentication option when prompted.

2. **During Deployment**: If key authentication fails, you'll be prompted for a password automatically.

3. **Configuration**: You can choose to save your password in the configuration file, but this is not recommended for security reasons.

## Testing Recommendations

When testing this release, focus on:

1. **Password Authentication**: Test deploying with password authentication to ensure it works correctly.

2. **Fallback Mechanism**: Test the automatic fallback to password authentication if key authentication fails.

3. **Error Handling**: Verify that error messages are clear and helpful when authentication issues occur.
