# DreamHost Deployer v0.4.1 Release Notes

This release focuses on fixing SSH key compatibility issues with DreamHost and improving the deployment process on Windows systems.

## Key Improvements

### 1. SSH Key Compatibility

We've addressed SSH key compatibility issues with DreamHost by:
- Switching from RSA to Ed25519 SSH keys for better security and compatibility
- Adding automatic detection of Ed25519 keys in the deployment process
- Creating a new `fix-ssh-key` command to help users diagnose and fix SSH key issues

### 2. Windows Deployment Fixes

We've improved the Windows deployment experience by:
- Fixing the "minimatch is not a function" error during SCP deployment
- Adding better error handling for SSH and SCP operations
- Improving file exclusion logic with fallback mechanisms

### 3. Error Handling

We've enhanced error reporting throughout the application:
- Added detailed error messages for failed directory creation
- Added specific error messages for file transfer failures
- Improved the display of SSH-related errors

## New Command: fix-ssh-key

The new `fix-ssh-key` command provides an interactive way to:
- Check your current SSH key configuration
- Generate new Ed25519 keys if needed
- Update your configuration to use the correct key type
- Display the public key for adding to DreamHost

## Testing Recommendations

When testing this release, focus on:

1. **SSH Key Generation**: Test the `fix-ssh-key` command to ensure it correctly generates and configures Ed25519 keys.

2. **Deployment Process**: Test the deployment process to ensure it correctly uses the Ed25519 keys and handles errors gracefully.

3. **Windows Compatibility**: If using Windows, verify that the SCP deployment method works correctly with the minimatch fix.
