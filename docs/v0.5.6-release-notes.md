# DreamHost Deployer v0.5.6 Release Notes

## Enhanced Vite Project Support

Version 0.5.6 adds specialized support for Vite-based projects, making deployment smoother and more efficient. If you're using Vite (with React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework), DreamHost Deployer now provides a tailored experience.

### Key Improvements

#### Smart Vite Project Detection
- Automatically detects Vite projects based on:
  - Presence of `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts`
  - Vite listed in `package.json` dependencies
  - Build commands that include "vite"

#### Optimized Default Settings
- Uses `dist` as the default output directory (Vite's standard)
- Configures appropriate build commands based on project setup
- Provides Vite-specific guidance during configuration

#### Intelligent Build Process
- Real-time build output with Vite-specific messages highlighted
- Specialized error detection and troubleshooting guidance
- Smarter handling of common Vite build issues

#### Deployment Optimizations
- Vite-specific file exclusions when deploying without build integration
- Verification of build output to ensure it contains expected Vite structure
- Better handling of static assets and efficient transfer

## Improved Build Integration

The build integration feature has been significantly enhanced:

- **Live Output Streaming**: See build progress in real-time
- **Improved Error Handling**: More detailed error reports with framework-specific solutions
- **Smart Recovery Options**: Deploy from source if build fails
- **Build Directory Validation**: Ensures the output directory exists and contains the expected files

## Enhanced CLI Experience

- **Project-Specific Settings**: New menu option for framework-specific configurations
- **Better Progress Reporting**: Clearer indication of what's happening during deployment
- **Improved Menu Organization**: Options now include helpful descriptions

## Using With Vite Projects

To deploy a Vite project:

1. Run `npx dreamhost-deployer` in your Vite project directory
2. Select "Deploy website to DreamHost" from the menu
3. The tool will automatically detect your Vite project and offer appropriate defaults
4. When prompted for build integration, select "Yes"
5. The deployer will build your project and deploy the optimized output

### Example Configuration for Vite

```json
{
  "host": "example.com",
  "username": "your-username",
  "remotePath": "/home/username/example.com",
  "localPath": "/path/to/your/vite-project",
  "buildIntegration": true,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
