# DreamHost Deployer v0.4.5 Release Notes

## Server Environment Check Feature

Version 0.4.5 introduces a new feature that automatically checks the server environment for NVM and Node.js before deployment. This ensures that your DreamHost server has the proper environment set up for running Node.js applications.

## Key Improvements

### Server Environment Check
- **Automatic Version Verification**: Checks if NVM and Node.js are installed on the server
- **Version Comparison**: Verifies installed versions against recommended versions (NVM 0.40.1, Node.js 20.18.0)
- **Interactive Setup**: Offers to set up or update NVM and Node.js if needed
- **Seamless Integration**: Runs automatically before deployment

### Enhanced Node.js Setup
- **Password Authentication Support**: Added support for password authentication in the setup-node command
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling for SSH connection issues
- **Improved Version Comparison**: More accurate version comparison logic
- **Detailed Progress Reporting**: Better feedback during the setup process

## Using the Server Environment Check

The server environment check runs automatically before deployment. When you run:

```
dreamhost-deployer deploy
```

The tool will:
1. Check if NVM and Node.js are installed on your DreamHost server
2. Verify if the installed versions meet the recommended versions
3. If needed, offer to set up or update NVM and Node.js

You can also run the Node.js setup manually:

```
dreamhost-deployer setup-node
```

## Why This Matters

Having the correct versions of NVM and Node.js on your server is crucial for:
- **Compatibility**: Ensures your application runs correctly
- **Security**: Keeps your environment up-to-date with security patches
- **Performance**: Takes advantage of performance improvements in newer versions
- **Consistency**: Maintains a consistent environment between development and production

## Testing Recommendations

When testing this release, please focus on:

1. **Server Environment Detection**: Verify that the tool correctly detects NVM and Node.js on your server
2. **Version Comparison**: Test with different versions to ensure proper comparison
3. **Setup Process**: Test the setup process on servers without NVM/Node.js
4. **Authentication Methods**: Verify both password and SSH key authentication work correctly

## Feedback

We welcome your feedback on this new feature. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please report them on GitHub.
