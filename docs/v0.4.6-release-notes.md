# DreamHost Deployer v0.4.6 Release Notes

## Robust SSH Authentication Diagnostics

Version 0.4.6 introduces significant improvements to SSH authentication handling, making it easier to diagnose and resolve connection issues when deploying to DreamHost servers.

## Key Improvements

### Robust SSH Authentication Diagnostics
- **Automatic Authentication Method Detection**: Automatically detects which authentication methods are supported by your server
- **Multiple Authentication Fallbacks**: Tries multiple authentication methods if the primary method fails
- **Detailed Troubleshooting Guidance**: Provides specific guidance for resolving SSH connection issues
- **New `check-server` Command**: Dedicated command to verify server environment independently
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Better handling of SSH connection failures with clear error messages

### Enhanced Server Environment Check
- **Improved SSH Connection Verification**: More reliable detection of SSH connectivity issues
- **Better Password Handling**: Option to save passwords for future operations with appropriate security warnings
- **Clearer User Guidance**: More detailed feedback throughout the verification process
- **Suppressed Unnecessary Errors**: Reduced noise from server command output
- **More Reliable NVM/Node Detection**: Better handling of edge cases in server environment detection

## Using the New Features

### Check Server Environment Independently

You can now check your server environment independently with the new command:

```
dreamhost-deployer check-server
```

This will verify:
1. SSH connectivity to your server
2. Available authentication methods
3. NVM and Node.js installations and versions

### Improved SSH Authentication

The SSH authentication process now:
1. Tries SSH key authentication first
2. Automatically detects available authentication methods on the server
3. Falls back to password authentication if key authentication fails
4. Provides detailed troubleshooting guidance if all methods fail

### Better Error Messages

When SSH connection issues occur, you'll now receive:
- Clear indication of which authentication methods are supported
- Specific guidance for resolving permission issues
- Instructions for checking SSH key permissions
- Commands to try for manual troubleshooting

## Why This Matters

Reliable SSH connectivity is crucial for:
- **Successful Deployments**: Ensures your files can be transferred to the server
- **Server Environment Setup**: Required for setting up NVM and Node.js
- **User Experience**: Reduces frustration from cryptic SSH error messages
- **Troubleshooting**: Makes it easier to diagnose and fix connection issues

## Testing Recommendations

When testing this release, please focus on:

1. **SSH Authentication**: Test both key and password authentication methods
2. **Connection Issues**: Intentionally use incorrect credentials to verify error handling
3. **Server Environment Check**: Use the new `check-server` command to verify functionality
4. **Authentication Fallbacks**: Test the fallback mechanisms when primary authentication fails

## Feedback

We welcome your feedback on these improvements. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for further enhancements, please report them on GitHub.
