# DreamHost Deployer v0.4.4 Release Notes

## Simplified Cross-Platform Deployment

Version 0.4.4 introduces a major improvement to the DreamHost Deployer tool with a simplified cross-platform deployment approach. This update focuses on making the deployment process more consistent and reliable across all operating systems.

## Key Improvements

### Simplified Deployment Method
- **Native SSH/SCP Deployment**: Standardized on SCP/SFTP for all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Eliminated rsync Dependency**: Removed the dependency on rsync for better cross-platform compatibility
- **Built-in SSH Client Support**: Leveraged the SSH client available on modern platforms (Windows 10+, macOS, Linux)
- **Improved File Transfer Reliability**: Enhanced file transfer process with native commands

### Streamlined Authentication
- **Password Authentication Focus**: Simplified authentication with a focus on password-based authentication
- **Clear Authentication Options**: Provided clear recommendations for authentication methods
- **Improved SSH Key Setup**: Enhanced SSH key setup instructions for advanced users
- **Better Connection Testing**: Improved SSH connection testing during setup

## Using the New Deployment Method

The new deployment method is now the default and requires no special configuration. Simply run:

```
dreamhost-deployer deploy
```

The tool will automatically use the native SSH/SCP commands available on your system, making deployment consistent across all platforms.

### Authentication Options

When setting up SSH with `dreamhost-deployer setup-ssh`, you'll now be presented with two clear options:

1. **Password Authentication** (Recommended for most users)
   - Works everywhere without additional setup
   - Interactive password prompt during deployment
   - Option to save password (not recommended for security reasons)

2. **SSH Key Authentication** (For advanced users)
   - More secure but requires additional setup
   - Ed25519 keys are used by default
   - Detailed guidance for manual key installation on server

## Testing Recommendations

When testing this release, please focus on:

1. **Cross-Platform Deployment**: Test on different operating systems to ensure consistent behavior
2. **Authentication Methods**: Verify both password and SSH key authentication work as expected
3. **File Transfer Reliability**: Check that all files are transferred correctly, especially with large deployments
4. **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios to ensure helpful error messages are provided

We welcome your feedback on this simplified approach. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please report them on GitHub.
